# friday-anime-night

## Intended user 
Friday Anime Night is meant for any adult who would enjoy a random food recipe to cook and anime to watch 
## Overview
Friday Anime Night was created for those who don't know what to watch or eat on date night. The application provides you with options for food and anime. Friday anime night lets you cycle through and save your favorite choices. If you don't like the anime or food option, you can choose another by clicking the refresh button. Regardless if it's date night or not, if you need some ideas to spruce up your evening, this app is for you. 

## Features 
This application has two different APIs, one generates a random food option, and the other generates a random anime show. The application allows you to click the refresh button as much as you want. This application allows you to save your favorite food and anime options. Every time a choice is populated for both API, a brief description is generated, and there is a link you can press to tell you more about the show or food recipe.
